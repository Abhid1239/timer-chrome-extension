## The "Why" Behind This Project

Ever hidden your taskbar for a coding interview on LeetCode and completely lost track of time? I have.

That's why I built Timer. While modern platforms have made their timers more complex, and other extensions disappear when you switch tabs, this tool brings back simple, persistent functionality. It's inspired by the clean, minimalist design of classic coding platform timers—it just works.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Always Visible & Persistent**: The timer stays on the page even when you switch tabs. It even remembers its state if you close and reopen your browser.
* **Real-Time Sync**: Start, stop, or reset the timer on one tab, and the state is instantly updated across all your other open tabs.
* **🎨 Enhanced Design**: Updated with improved typography, better icon sizing, and refined visual styling for a more polished look.
* **🖱️ Drag & Drop Positioning**: Simply drag the timer anywhere on the page to set a custom position. No more being limited to preset corners!
* **⚡ Smooth Interactions**: Optimized dragging experience with immediate response and smooth movement.
* **📱 Responsive Layout**: Better box-sizing and improved time display formatting for consistent appearance.
* **Minimalist UI**: A clean, simple interface with just the essentials: Start, Stop, and Reset. No distractions.
* **Collapsible Design**: Click the arrow to collapse the controls into a single, unobtrusive icon.
* **Fully Configurable**: Use the extension popup to:
    * Toggle the timer's visibility on and off.
    * Choose from preset positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right).
    * Or drag the timer anywhere for custom positioning.
